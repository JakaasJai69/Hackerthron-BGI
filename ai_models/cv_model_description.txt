Swarn Sanskriti Computer Vision Model Description
-------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
- To enable Digital Museum features such as artifact visualization, image recognition, and classification.
- To support AI-driven analysis of cultural artifacts, including object detection and image enhancement.

Technologies & Libraries:
- OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction.
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for training deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for artifact classification.
- Pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) fine-tuned on cultural heritage image datasets.
- Node.js backend microservice to serve CV model predictions via REST API.

Architecture:
- Image preprocessing: resizing, normalization, augmentation.
- Model: CNN-based classifier trained on labeled artifact images.
- Postprocessing: confidence scoring and metadata extraction.
- API: Endpoints for image upload and classification results.

Example Pseudo-code:

1. Receive image upload via API
2. Preprocess image using OpenCV
3. Pass image through CNN model for classification
4. Return predicted artifact category and confidence score

Notes:
- Use data augmentation to improve model robustness.
- Consider integrating with frontend for real-time artifact recognition.
- Store model weights and metadata securely for scalability.
