Swarn Sanskriti NLP Model Description
-------------------------------------

Purpose:
- To build an AI Heritage Chatbot capable of understanding and responding to queries related to Indian cultural heritage.
- To support language learning modules with NLP capabilities such as tokenization, named entity recognition, and translation.

Technologies & Libraries:
- spaCy for NLP pipeline and entity recognition.
- BERT or a fine-tuned transformer model for contextual understanding and question answering.
- Integration with Google Translate API for multilingual support.
- Node.js backend to serve the NLP model via REST API or microservice.

Architecture:
- Preprocessing: Text normalization, tokenization using spaCy.
- Model: Fine-tuned BERT model trained on cultural heritage datasets and FAQs.
- Postprocessing: Response generation and formatting.
- API: Expose endpoints for chatbot queries and language processing.

Example Pseudo-code:

1. Load spaCy and BERT models
2. Receive user query via API
3. Preprocess query text
4. Use BERT model to generate response
5. Return response to frontend chatbot

Notes:
- Use transfer learning to fine-tune BERT on domain-specific data.
- Use caching for frequent queries to improve performance.
- Consider fallback to rule-based responses for unknown queries.
